## Project Description

The Arduino Training Kit is a comprehensive learning platform that provides hands-on experience with Arduino microcontrollers and their programming environment. It aims to facilitate understanding of electronics and programming concepts through practical experimentation.
The code that operats the training kit is written in arduino which is a language similar to C/C++.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: The kit consists of modular components, including sensors, actuators, and display modules, allowing for flexible and customizable projects.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Included tutorials guide users through basic Arduino programming, circuit design, and sensor interfacing.
- **Real-time Feedback**: LEDs, displays, and serial communication provide real-time feedback, aiding in understanding circuit behavior.
- **Open-Source**: All source code and documentation are open-source, encouraging modification and extension of the kit.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**: Assemble the components according to the provided instructions.
2. **Software Installation**: Install the Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. **Upload Sample Code**: Use the provided sample projects in the `examples` directory and upload them to the Arduino board.
4. **Experiment**: Explore tutorials and sample projects, modifying code and circuit designs to create custom projects.

## Code
The code written in this poject is a functional test for the Arduino-based training kit's capability to perform LED light pattern sequences triggered by pressing one of the push buttons. It verifies that the system responds correctly to user input by initiating a specific LED sequence when a push button is pressed and displaying the name of the sequence on an LCD display.
Several other functions can as well be carried out making use of one or more of the sensors being connected to the arduino board.
